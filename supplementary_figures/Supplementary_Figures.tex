  reference annotation, which contains numerous false negative and

  Flow diagram of the evaluation for Challenge 1. Benchmarks and additional
  orthogonal data that was used for the evaluation are indicated. For example,
  CAGE and QuantSeq data from WTC11 cells were generated and made available
  only after participant submissions; therefore, they represent “hidden”
  data. These was used to define 5’ transcript starts and 3’ ends.

  Flow diagram of the evaluation for Challenge 2. a) Evaluation of Challenge
  2 can be separated into metrics when a ground truth is known or a ground
  truth is unknown. b) Example analyses to evaluate transcript expression
  using the cell mixing experiment. A sample, H1_mix, was initially provided
  for quantification which was a mix of H1 cells and endodermal cells at an
  undisclosed ratio. After the initial submission, the individual H1 and
  endodermal cell samples were released and participants submitted
  quantifications for each.

  Flow diagram of the evaluation for Challenge 3. Only SIRVs are available for
  ground truth information. The evaluation was based on a comparative
  assessment of the predictions followed by targeting specific candidates for
  further validation.

  Experimental validation approaches for the LRGASP challenges. (A) Multiple
  categories of types of transcript were selected for validation (shown in
  green boxes). These loci will be viewed in the UCSC Genome Browser along
  with additional datasets to aid in the manual design of primers. Amplicons
  will be analyzed by fragment size and pooled to perform long-read sequencing
  with PacBio and ONT (B) A select number of genes were selected for
  transcript isoform-specific qPCR. A combination of probes detecting
  constitutive and alternative regions will be used. (C) RT-PCR validation
  will be performed similar to Challenge 1, except transcript were selected
  from well-studied mammalian immune-related genes.

  Designing validation primers. a) An example of a unique intron in transcript
  NNC_381534 to validation.  The green and blue region vertical highlights
  indicate the manually selected primer pair regions.  The 'Targets' track,
  produced by Primers-Juju, recapitulates the region as blue item B2M+1, and
  transcript with the maximal possible amplicon drawn in thick boxes. b) The
  Primers-Juju track hub with the addition of the primer pairs design. This
  adds Primer3 results (Primers track) and the most stable primer along with
  the amplicon sequence for the target transcript (Amplicons track).
